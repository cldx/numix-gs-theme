KNOWN ISSUES:
Favourite bar opened apps (hovered apps) selection
Dash categories 
Show apps bg colour on hover  ....meaning? [joern]
Needs new images:
[georgi]Switches (mind if i redo those? [joern]
[georgi]Notification Area (?? what Image)
[georgi]Checkboxes 
Border radius on Switches should use the same values as other elements (e.g. hovered list items)
The Switches don't really show if they are on or off, we need to fix that
Crazy jumping of Text in the Panel needs to go (probably margin issues and/or caused by the border on Panel Elements during hover
Crazy jumping of List Elements need to go (e.g. the Status selection in the User Menu Popup), probably margin issues
The Message Tray is sqeezed downwards, it should have the same margin top/bottom as it does left/right for the AppIcons that are living there

Best Idea would be to take advantage of bugs in github, i'm gonna push major issues there from now.
We should assing tasks to ourselves by prepending the Issue with our name (like i did above) so we know what not to touch for now and 
what everybody is working on.


FIXED FROM THE TIME OF THE PREVIOUS TARBALL:
Outlines issues
Modal dialogs
Favourite bar (+tooltips)
Switches
Checkboxes
Notification Area
Notification popups
The Control+Alt+Arrow overlay
Dash scrollbars
[joern]Added new Window Close Buttons with a nice hover state
