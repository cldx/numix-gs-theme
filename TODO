KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Modal dialogs buttons - negative(s) - grey, positive - red 
 - Weather
 - GDM/Login/Lock
 - Close buttons - the fill colour should be more red shade of grey
 - Nofications bubbles - the Close buttons are hard to see unless you hover on them (actually the buttom design could use redoing)
 - process-working images (both svg and png) must be red coloured, not blue
 - Callendars arrow - the non hover ones should be lighter (50,50,50,1.0), the hover ones should be red
 - All borders should be with 2px rounded edges
 - The borders of the widgets in the Activities overview should be dark and transparent so they won't stick out that much
 - Needs code cleanup
 - Maybe some other issues

Fixed in this release:
 - Panel secltor
 - Workspace Ctrl+Alt+Arrow overlay 

Fixed in previous releases:
 - Everythine else :> (jonestly - way too much to write it all down, plus it will just create clutter in the file)
