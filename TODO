KNOWN ISSUES:
 - Shutdown dialog red button misses hover state
 - Weather (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/613/weather/)
 - GDM/Login/Lock
 - Close buttons and workspace switcher "circle" - the fill colour should be more red shade of grey
 - Nofications bubbles - light notifactions for chat, dark for everything else. The current ones are dark only
 - Needs code cleanup
 - Maybe some other issues

Fixed in this release:
 - All borders should be with 2px rounded edges
 - The borders of the widgets in the Activities overview should be dark and transparent so they won't stick out that much
 - Callendars arrow - the non hover ones should be lighter, the hover ones should be red (#d64937)
 - process-working images (both svg and png) are white coloured (transparency to opaqueness) and not blue
 - Search box is overlapping panel, there must be some spacing between them
 - Modal dialogs buttons: negative(s) - grey (20,20,20,1.0 with text colour 249,249,249, 0.80), positive - red (214,73,55,1.0 with text colour 249,249,249,1.0)
 - Shutdown dialogs buttons: <same as modal>
 - Notifications text colour
 - Alt+Tab fixes

Fixed in previous releases:
 - Way too much to write it all down, plus it will just create clutter in the file
